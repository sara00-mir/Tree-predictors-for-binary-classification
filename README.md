**ABSTRACT 

This study explores the creation and application of decision tree and random forest classifiers aimed
 at predicting the edibility of mushrooms based on their attributes. Both models were developed manually
 in Python, encompassing stages like data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, hyperparam
eter optimization, and performance assessment. The decision tree and random forest classifiers both
 demonstrated exceptional accuracy, highlighting the effectiveness of the implemented algorithms and
 the dataset’s quality. Additionally, the report delves into the theoretical aspects of decision trees and
 random forests, discussing split criteria, methods to prevent overfitting, and a comparative analysis of
 the models’ performances.
